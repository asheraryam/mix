# How to calculate the hexadecimal value of a base 10 number

Let’s first start off by dividing 2,087 by 16. That should get us a result of 130 with a remainder of 7. According to our chart from above, 7 is also ‘7’ in hexadecimal, so now we need to set ‘7’ aside and divide 130 by 16. Our answer is 8 with a remainder of 2. On our chart, 2 is ‘2’, so set that to the side and we need to divide 8 by 16. This will get us 0 with a remainder of 8, which translate to ‘8’ in hex. So we have our 3 results which are 7, 2 and 8. We will put them together in reverse order to get our hexadecimal value which means that 2,087 is ‘0x827’. 0x is there to symbolize that it is a hex value.

Hexadecimal value of 2087

2087/16 = 130 r 7
-->7

130/16 = 8 r 2
-->2

8/16 = 0 r 8
-->8

0x827


Hexadecimal value of 436
Numbers between 10 and 15 need to be changed to A-F

436/16 = 27 r 4
-->4

27/16 = 1 r 11
-->B

1/16 = 0 r 1
-->1

0x1B4


Hexadecimal value of 255

Let’s try another, this time we will try the number 255. First we need to divide 255 by 16. That will get us 15 with a remainder of 15. Now we take the remainder and line it up to our chart. 15 translate to ‘F’, so we can save ‘F’ for later. Now we need to divide 15 by 16, which will get us 0 with a remainder of 15. We know that 15 translates to ‘F’, which makes our result ‘0xFF’.

255/16 = 15 r 15
-->F

15/16 = 0 r 15
-->F

0xFF

STOP WHEN YOU GET TO 0
